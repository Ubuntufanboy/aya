# Plugin Feature Documentation

## Overview

The plugin feature in our logging program allows users to extend its functionality by writing custom plugins in Python. Plugins can be attached to log events, and they run in an isolated environment to ensure safety and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### 1. Plugin Creation

To create a plugin, follow these steps:

- Create a Python class that extends a base plugin class or implements a specific interface.
- Implement the required methods or properties defined by the plugin interface.
- Save the plugin file with a `.py` extension.

Example Plugin (`sample_plugin.py`):

```python
class SamplePlugin:
    def execute(self, log_data):
        # Your plugin logic here
        pass
```

### 2. Registering a Plugin

Register your plugin with the logging program by calling the `register_plugin` method:

```python
from logging_program import Logger, SamplePlugin

# Instantiate the Logger
logger = Logger()

# Instantiate the Plugin
sample_plugin = SamplePlugin()

# Register the plugin
logger.register_plugin(sample_plugin)
```

## Using Plugins

After registering a plugin, it will be executed when the logging program logs an event. The plugin's `execute` method will run in an isolated environment.

```python
# Log an event
logger.log("Log message with attached plugins")
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure your plugin class follows the required interface or inherits from the base plugin class.
- Implement proper error handling in your plugin to avoid crashing the logging program.
- Test your plugin in isolation before registering it with the logging program.

## Example

For a complete example, refer to the provided sample plugin (`sample_plugin.py`) and the integration in the `logging_program`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your plugin, check the error messages and reach out to me for possible solutions. Ensure your plugin is compatible with the Aya version.
